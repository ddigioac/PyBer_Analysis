## Overview of the PyBer Analysis

### Purpose

In this analysis I will be examining ride-sharing data by city type to summarize key differences and demonstrate how this information can impact future business decisions. 

## PyBer Results

The total amount of rides and drivers was far greater in urban cities than it was in rural and suburban cities. However, the average fare per ride and the average fare per driver was highest in rural cities. Overall the total fare was largest in urban cities, while the lowest total fares came from rural cities.

## PyBer Summary
Three business recommendations I would make are: 
- To increase the number of drivers in urban cities. This will allow more rides to be completed and achieve higher total fares for the company.
- To implement a flat rate fee for rural city drivers. Although rural city rides have the largest average fare per ride and per driver, they are completing less jobs. For shorter distance rides in rural cities, this would allow drivers to be compensated appropriately.
- To decrease the amount of drivers in suburban cities. With less drivers, the average fare per driver in suburban cities would increase.
